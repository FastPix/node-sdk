   * Add media to a playlist by ID

   * @remarks
   * This endpoint allows you to add one or more media items to an existing playlist. By passing the media ID(s) in the request, the specified media items are appended to the playlist in the order provided.
   * #### How it works
   *
   *  - When a user sends a PATCH request to this endpoint with the `playlistId` as path parameter and a list of media ID(s) in the request body, FastPix adds the specified media items to the playlist and returns the updated playlist details.
   *
   * #### Example
   * An e-learning platform adds new video tutorials to the "Beginner Python Series" playlist by sending their media IDs in the request. The playlist is updated with the new content, ensuring learners have access to the latest tutorials in sequence.

   *  - When a user sends a DELETE request to this endpoint with the playlist ID as the path parameter and the media ID(s) to be removed in the request body, FastPix deletes the specified media items from the playlist and returns the updated playlist details.
   *
   * #### Example
   * An e-learning platform removes outdated video tutorials from the "Beginner Python Series" playlist by specifying their media IDs in the request. The playlist is updated to exclude these items, ensuring learners only access relevant content.
