  /**
   * Create a simulcast
   *
   * @remarks
   * Creates a simulcast for a parent live stream. Simulcasting allows you to broadcast a live stream to multiple social platforms simultaneously (for example, YouTube, Facebook, or Twitch). This helps expand your audience reach across platforms. A simulcast can only be created when the parent live stream is in the idle state (not currently live or disabled). Only one simulcast target can be created per API call.
   * #### How it works
   *
   * 1. Change to: When you call this endpoint, provide the parent `streamId` along with the simulcast target details (such as platform and credentials). The API returns a unique `simulcastId`, which you can use to manage the simulcast later.
   *
   * 2. To notify your application about the status of simulcast related events check for the <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/webhooks-collection#simulcast-target-events">webhooks for simulcast</a> target events.
   *
   * #### Example
   * An event manager sets up a live stream for a virtual conference and wants to simulcast the stream on YouTube and Facebook Live. They first create the primary live stream in FastPix, ensuring it's in the idle state. Then, they use the API to create a simulcast target for YouTube.

  /**
   * Get a specific simulcast
   *
   * @remarks
   * Retrieves the details of a specific simulcast associated with a parent live stream. By providing both the `streamId` of the parent stream and the `simulcastId`, FastPix returns detailed information about the simulcast, such as the stream URL, the status of the simulcast, and metadata.
   *
   * #### Example
   * This endpoint can be used to verify the status of the simulcast on external platforms before the live stream begins. For example, before starting a live gaming event, the organizer wants to ensure that the simulcast to Twitch is set up correctly. They retrieve the simulcast information to confirm that everything is properly configured.

   * Update a simulcast
   *
   * @remarks
   * Updates the status of a specific simulcast linked to a parent live stream. You can enable or disable the simulcast at any time while the parent stream is active or idle. After the live stream is disabled, the simulcast can no longer be modified.
   *
   * Webhook event: <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/live-events#videolive_streamsimulcast_targetupdated">video.live_stream.simulcast_target.updated</a>
   *
   * #### Example
   * When a `PATCH` request is made to this endpoint, the API updates the status of the simulcast. This can be useful for pausing or resuming a simulcast on a particular platform without stopping the parent live stream.
