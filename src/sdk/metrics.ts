  /**
   * List breakdown values
   *
   * @remarks
   * Retrieves breakdown values for a specified metric and timespan, allowing you to analyze the performance of your content based on various dimensions. It provides insights into how different factors contribute to the overall metrics.
   *
   * #### How it works
   *
   *   1. Before using this endpoint, you can call the <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/list_dimensions">List Dimensions</a> endpoint to retrieve all available dimensions that can be used in your query.
   *
   *   2. Send a `GET` request to this endpoint with the required `metricId` and other query parameters.
   *
   *   3. You receive a response containing the breakdown values for the specified metric, grouped and filtered according to your parameters.
   *
   *   4. Upon successful retrieval, the response includes the breakdown values based on the specified parameters. Note that the time values ( `totalWatchTime` and `totalPlayingTime` ) are in milliseconds
   *
   * #### Example
   *
   * A developer wants to analyze how watch time varies across different device types. By calling this endpoint for the `playing_time` metric and filtering by `device_type`, they can understand how engagement differs between mobile, desktop, and tablet users. This data guides optimization efforts for different platforms.
   *
   * #### Key fields in response
   *
   *   * **views:** The count of views based based on the applied filters.
   *
   *   * **value:** The specific metric value calculated based on the applied filters.
   *   * **totalWatchTime:** Total time watched across all views, represented in milliseconds.
   *
   *   * **totalPlayTime:** Total time spent playing the video, represented in milliseconds.
   *   * **field:** The grouping field value based on the groupBy parameter.
