  /**
   * Get all clips of a live stream
   *
   * @remarks
   * Retrieves a list of all media clips generated from a specific livestream. Each media entry includes metadata such as the clip media IDs, and other relevant details. A media clip is a segmented portion of an original media file (source live stream). Clips are often created for various purposes such as previews, highlights, or customized edits.
   * #### How it works
   * 1. Provide the livestreamId as a parameter when calling this endpoint.
   *
   * 2. The API returns a paginated list of media clips created from the specified livestream.
   *
   * 3. Pagination helps maintain performance and usability when handling large sets of media files, making it easier to organize and manage content in bulk.
   *
   * #### Use case
   * Suppose you’re hosting a live gaming event and want to showcase key moments from the stream — such as top plays or final match highlights. You can use this endpoint to fetch all clips generated from that livestream, display them in your dashboard, or use them for post-event editing and sharing.

  /**
   * Create a new stream
   *
   * @remarks
   * Creates a new <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/get-started-with-live-streaming">RTMPS</a> or <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/using-srt-to-live-stream">SRT</a> live stream in FastPix. When you create a stream, FastPix generates a unique `streamKey` and `srtSecret` that you can use with broadcasting software such as OBS to connect to FastPix RTMPS or SRT servers. Use SRT for live streaming in unstable network conditions, as it provides error correction and encryption for a more reliable and secure broadcast.
   *
   * Leverage SRT for live streaming in environments with unstable networks, taking advantage of its error correction and encryption features for a resilient and secure broadcast.
   *
   * <h4>How it works</h4>
   *
   * 1. Send a `POST` request to this endpoint. You can configure the stream settings, including `metadata` (such as stream name and description), `reconnectWindow` (in case of disconnection), and privacy options (`public` or `private`).
   *
   * 2. FastPix returns the stream details for both RTMPS and SRT configurations. These keys and IDs from the stream details are essential for connecting the broadcasting software to FastPix’s servers and transmitting the live stream to viewers.
   *
   * 3. After the live stream is created, FastPix sends a `POST` request to your specified webhook endpoint with the event <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/live-events#videolive_streamcreated">video.live_stream.created</a>.
   *
   * **Example:**
   *
   *   Imagine a gaming platform that allows users to live stream gameplay directly from their dashboard. The API creates a new stream, provides the necessary stream key, and sets it to "private" so that only specific viewers can access it.

   * #### How it works
   *
   * Use the access token and secret key related to the workspace in the request header. When called, the API provides a paginated response containing all the live streams in that specific workspace. This is helpful for retrieving a large volume of streams and managing content in bulk.

  /**
   * Delete a stream
   *
   * @remarks
   * Permanently deletes a specified live stream from the workspace. If the stream is active, the encoder is disconnected and ingestion stops immediately. This action is irreversible, and any future playback attempts fail as a result.
   *
   *   Provide the `streamId` in the request to terminate active connections and remove the stream from the workspace. You can further look for <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/live-events#videolive_streamdeleted">video.live_stream.deleted</a> webhook to notify your system about the status.
   *
   *   #### Example
   *
   *   For an online concert platform, a trial stream was mistakenly made public. The event manager deletes the stream before the concert begins to avoid confusion among viewers.

  /**
   * Enable a stream
   *
   * @remarks
   * This endpoint allows you to enable a livestream by transitioning its status from `disabled` to `idle`. After it is enabled, the stream becomes available and ready to accept an incoming broadcast from a streaming tool.
   *
   * Streams on the trial plan cannot be re-enabled if they are in the `disabled` state.
   *
   * The `livestreamId` must be provided in the path, and the stream must not already be in an enabled state (`idle`, `preparing`, or `active`).
   *
   * #### Example
   *
   * A creator disables a livestream to pause it temporarily. Later, they decide to continue the session. By calling this endpoint with the stream's ID, they can re-enable and restart the same livestream.
